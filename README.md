# mecha

Mecha is yet another actor model implementation written in Rust.

There are already Rust crates implementing such model. I'll give a shout out to [RobotS](https://github.com/gamazeps/RobotS) and [acto-rs](https://github.com/dbeck/acto-rs), but I suspect there are others, and some building blocks are there in other libraries.

The main reason why I am writing this library is as a learning exercise, and it should not be expected to be feature-complete (I wish!) or stable.

Do not use this in production code.
